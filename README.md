# interpreter
A fun little past time project:
an interperer with a creative name and C-like syntax.
any character recognised as a text character by the en_GB.UTF-8 locale is allowed as identifier.

The documentation is horrible or rather nonexistant, that should probably change.

No dependencies, uses c++ 17 standard library.
